🎥 Predicting Movie Ratings with Python 🧠✨🎬
📜 Project Overview
This project is part of my CodSoft Internship, where I explored the fascinating world of machine learning and data science to predict movie ratings. Using features like genre, cast, budget, etc., I trained and evaluated multiple models to understand their performance in prediction tasks.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries Used:
Pandas 🗃️
NumPy 🔢
Scikit-learn 🧠
Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊
🚀 Objectives
Preprocess and clean the dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Build and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models.
Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
🛠️ Models 
Linear Regression: MSE = 0.8776, R² = -0.0013
KNN Regressor: MSE = 1.0157, R² = -0.1589
Decision Tree: MSE = 1.0165, R² = -0.1598
