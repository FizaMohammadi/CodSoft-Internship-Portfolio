🌸 Iris Flower Classification 🌱
📜 Project Overview
In this project, I built a classification model using the Iris dataset to predict the species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model was trained using key features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries:
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
🚀 Objective
Classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on their physical features using machine learning algorithms.

🏆 Results
SVM: Accuracy = 96.67%
Random Forest: Accuracy = 100% 🎯
📂 Project Structure
data/: Contains the Iris dataset.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with code for training and evaluating models.
