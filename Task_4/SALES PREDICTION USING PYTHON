🚀 Sales Prediction Model
📜 Project Overview
In this project, I developed a sales prediction model to forecast product sales based on factors such as advertising expenditure,
target audience, and platform selection (TV, Radio, Newspaper). Using machine learning algorithms,
I analyzed historical data to make accurate predictions about future sales.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries:
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
🔧 Algorithms Used
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor

🎯 Objective
The goal of this project was to predict product sales based on advertising factors and to understand the impact of each factor on sales performance. 
The model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.

📂 Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with the code to train and evaluate the models.
